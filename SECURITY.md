## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to report it to us.

Please follow the guidelines below for reporting a vulnerability:
Do not create a public issue: To maintain the security of our users, we ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability.
Instead, please email us at security@example.com with the details of the issue. 

Provide a detailed report:
In your email, please include as much information as possible to help us understand the vulnerability. This may include a description of the issue, the affected version(s), steps to reproduce, potential impact, and any suggested mitigations.

Expect an initial response:
We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours. We will then assess the issue and provide updates on our progress in addressing it. Depending on the complexity of the issue, this process may take varying amounts of time.

Stay in communication:
We may contact you for further information or clarification during our assessment. Please be available to respond to our queries, as this will help expedite the resolution process.

Vulnerability acceptance or decline:
After our assessment, we will determine whether the reported vulnerability is valid and applicable to our project. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work on fixing it and release a security update. We will also credit you for discovering and reporting the issue, unless you prefer to remain anonymous. If the vulnerability is declined, we will provide an explanation for our decision.

Thank you for helping us keep our project secure and protecting the privacy of our users.
